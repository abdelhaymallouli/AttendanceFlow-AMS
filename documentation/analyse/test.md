# 🧪 School Absence Management System (AMS)

> **Design Thinking Phase 5: Test**

The Testing phase focuses on putting our created prototypes into the hands of our real users (Administrator, Teachers, and Students). We aim to gather feedback, identify friction points, and iteratively refine the software before launching the final product.

## 🎯 1. Testing Objectives

*   **Validate the "Double-Entry" Fix:** Ensure the Administrator feels confident moving away from paper and reducing their 4-6 hours of data lag.
*   **Measure Efficiency:** Time how quickly a teacher can complete attendance on the mobile/web interface.
*   **Assess Intuition:** Observe if users can naturally navigate the Student Portal and upload a medical note without external guidance.

## 👥 2. Key Testing Scenarios & Participants

### **A. The Teacher Scenario**
*   **Participant:** A sample of 3-5 teachers with varying levels of tech-savviness.
*   **Scenario:** *"Imagine you are in your first-period class of 30 students. Two students are absent, one is late. Please record their attendance."*
*   **Metric:** Time to completion and error rate.

### **B. The Administrator Scenario**
*   **Participant:** Madam Hannane (The Primary Persona).
*   **Scenario:** *"It is 10:30 AM. Review the morning attendance. Identify the absent students and approve the medical note submitted by Student X."*
*   **Metric:** Her perceived cognitive load and satisfaction with the visual "scan-ability" (colors/icons).

### **C. The Student Scenario**
*   **Participant:** 2-3 Students.
*   **Scenario:** *"You were sick yesterday. Please check your absence record and submit a picture of your doctor's note for justification."*
*   **Metric:** Ease of finding the upload button and understanding the status indicators.

## 📊 3. Feedback Processing

As we gather feedback, we will categorize it to determine necessary improvements:

*   **Must-Fix (Critical):** Bugs or severe usability issues blocking a task (e.g., "Submit button is hidden on mobile").
*   **Should-Fix (High Priority):** Confusion or slow navigation that frustrates the user (e.g., "I couldn't tell the difference between 'Late' and 'Absent' colors immediately").
*   **Could-Fix (Nice-To-Have):** Small aesthetic tweaks or minor feature requests.

## 🏁 4. Finalizing the Process

The Test phase is highly iterative. If a prototype fails a scenario, we return to the **Ideate** or **Prototype** phase, make the necessary adjustments, and test again.

Once the users can complete their core tasks fluidly and without errors, the Design Thinking process transitions into the **Development and Implementation** phase for the final AttendanceFlow-AMS.
