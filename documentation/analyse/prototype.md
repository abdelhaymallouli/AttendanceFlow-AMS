# 🎨 School Absence Management System (AMS)

> **Design Thinking Phase 4: Prototype**

With our problems defined and ideas generated, this phase focuses on creating tangible, testable versions of our solutions. We are translating the functional needs into user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) designs.

---

## 📱 1. Prototyping Goals

*   **Visualize the Solutions:** Transform abstract concepts from the 'Ideate' phase into interactive or static screens.
*   **Test Usability Quickly:** Create low-fidelity (wireframes) to high-fidelity (mockups) designs to get early feedback before development.
*   **Focus on the "Double-Entry" Fix:** Prioritize the screens where data is inputted (Teachers) and verified (Administration).

## 🖥️ 2. Key Interfaces to Prototype

### **A. Teacher's Input Interface (Mobile/Web)**
*   **Goal:** Allow teachers to record attendance in under 2 minutes.
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   Class list with clear "Present" / "Absent" / "Late" toggle buttons.
    *   Quick "Select All as Present" button to save time.
    *   Simple submit button to instantly sync data.

### **B. Administration's Verification Dashboard (The Hub)**
*   **Goal:** Provide Madam Hannane with a quick, color-coded overview of the entire school's attendance status.
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   High-level metrics (e.g., Total Present, Total Absent, Pending Justifications).
    *   List of absent students highlighting unverified or unexcused absences.
    *   Action shortcuts to "Approve" or "Reject" submitted medical notes.
    *   Export button for daily reports.

### **C. Student/Parent Transparency Portal**
*   **Goal:** Allow students to check their absence record and justification status without visiting the office.
*   **Key Elements:**
    *   Simple summary of total absences.
    *   List of submitted justifications with their current status (Pending, Approved, Rejected).
    *   A clean, easy-to-use "Upload Document" button for new medical notes.

## 🛠️ 3. Prototyping Tools & Approach

*   **Low-Fidelity:** Pen and paper sketches or simple wireframes (using Balsamiq or Figma wireframe kits) to agree on layout and user flow.
*   **High-Fidelity:** Interactive mockups using Figma or Tailwind templates, applying the project's color scheme (e.g., clear indicators for absent/present) and typography.

## 🚀 4. Transitioning to the Next Phase

Once the prototypes are built, they will be shared with the key personas (Madam Hannane, teachers, and students) to gather feedback on usability, efficiency, and clarity in the final **Test** phase.
