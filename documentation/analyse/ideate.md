# 💡 School Absence Management System (AMS)

> **Design Thinking Phase 3: Ideate**

Following our Define phase, we brainstormed solutions to address the "Double-Entry" workflow and the friction experienced by Administrator Madam Hannane and the students.

## 🚀 1. The Core Vision: Fluid & Real-Time

Our goal is to create a system where data is entered once, safely, and immediately available to those who need it. We want to transform the Administrator's role from "Data Entry" to "Data Verification."

## 🎯 2. Proposed High-Level Solutions

### **Solution A: Teacher Direct-Entry (Mobile/Web)**
* **Concept:** Teachers mark attendance digitally in the classroom during the first 10 minutes of class.
* **Why it works:** Eliminates the physical collection of paper slips. The data is instantly recorded at the source.

### **Solution B: The "Verification Hub" for Administrators**
* **Concept:** A dashboard for Madam Hannane that uses color-coding (e.g., Red for Absent, Green for Present, Yellow for Justified) to quickly scan status.
* **Why it works:** Reduces cognitive load. She no longer has to read every name, just verify the exceptions and handle justification uploads.

### **Solution C: Student Transparency Portal**
* **Concept:** A simple portal where students can log in to check their absence status and if their justification was accepted.
* **Why it works:** Reduces the physical visits to the administration office, saving time for both the student and the administrator.

## 🛠️ 3. Feature Brainstorming

* **Automated Alerts:** Send automatic notifications to administration if a student is marked absent in consecutive classes.
* **Digital Justification Upload:** Replace physical medical notes. Students/Parents can take a picture and upload it. The Admin then clicks "Approve" or "Reject."
* **Exportable Reports:** One-click generation of Excel/PDF reports for the end-of-day summary.

## 🔄 4. Transitioning to the Next Phase

These ideas aim directly at the pain points identified. Next, we will formalize these into concrete visual representations in the "Prototype" phase.
