# 🔬 School Absence Management System (AMS)

> **Design Thinking Phase 2: Define**

Based on our empathy research, we can now clearly define the core problems that AttendanceFlow-AMS must solve.

## 📌 1. The Problem Statement

**For the Administrator (Madam Hannane):**
The Attendance Administrator needs a way to receive real-time, digital attendance data from teachers because the current paper-based double-entry system causes a 4-6 hour data lag, high cognitive exhaustion, and increases the risk of recording errors.

**For the Student:**
Students need a transparent way to view their attendance and justification status because the current system requires physical office visits that interrupt both their day and the administration's workflow.

## ❓ 2. "How Might We" (HMW) Questions

To guide our prototyping, we asked:

1. **HMW** eliminate the physical transfer of attendance paper slips from the classroom to the admin office?
2. **HMW** allow the Administrator to process 120+ students' status with just a glance instead of reading every line?
3. **HMW** digitize the submission and approval of medical notes/justifications?

## 📋 3. Functional Needs Identified

From our problem statements, the system *must* have:

* **Role-Based Access:** Distinct views and permissions for Teachers (Entry), Administrators (Verification/Approval), and Students (View-Only).
* **Real-Time Sync:** Data entered by a teacher must instantly appear on the Admin's dashboard.
* **Visual Status Indicators:** UI must rely heavily on visual cues (colors, icons) for quick scanning.
* **Digital Attachment System:** Capability to upload and store image/PDF files linked to specific absence records for justification.

## 🎯 4. Moving Forward

With the problem clearly defined, we will move towards the Ideation phase to brainstorm potential solutions.
